## Class 3 demo

In this class, we learned a git-based workflow. We did the following:

- Cloned our learning journals to our computers: `git clone url-of-the-learning-journal-repo`
- Navigated into that folder, then opened our learning journals in VS Code: `code .`
- Separated out each class's content into its own file, and then made a table of contents in the README linking to each file
- Used git to add our changes to the staging area: `git add .`
- Made a commit: `git commit -m "Separated content into separate files for each class`
- Pushed that commit to GitHub: `git push origin master`

The result is that our learning journals now have a cleaner format, with a file for each day and a handy table of contents. We'll use this format for each class going forward.
